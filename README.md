### Must
* API use `TypeScript`
* UI use `React` and `Tailwindcss`

## Setup
As this test is to evaluate basic `Full Stack` and `JavaScript` skills, we are not be focusing on tooling setup (webpack, babel, etc...).

So feel free to use [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to jump start your development, although if not comfortable custom setup is also welcomed.
